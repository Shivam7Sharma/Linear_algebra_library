# Linear_Algebra
Implementation of Matrix multiplication and transposition

To run the program please run on terminal: g++ main.cpp Linear_Algebra.cpp

I didn't have much time to complete this exercise so I coundn't use reference variables and constant pointers for memory efficiency

Main.cpp is for testing the progam for AxA, AxI and A', but the code can run for any general MxN matrix.
